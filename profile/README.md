# IMPETUS â€“ IMPET build your wind energy future with US
## Enhancing wind energy production in the South Baltic area through student-driven innovation and cross-border collaboration.
IMPETUS project is co-financed from the Interreg South Baltic Programme 2021-2027 through the European Regional Development Fund (Project: IMPETUS, STHB.02.01-IP.01-0001/25).
## Project Consortium
Impetus consortium consists of 7 partners from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and Sweden. The Lead Partner is the Institute of Fluid-Flow Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences (IMP PAN). 
# Project Overview
The IMPETUS Project aims to boost the green and blue growth potential of the South Baltic Area (SBA) by fostering innovation in renewable energy. Through cross-border collaboration, it focuses on developing Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) technology as a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable alternative to conventional wind systems.
# Key Focus Areas
- Promote cross-border collaboration in the South Baltic Area (SBA) for renewable energy innovation.
- Develop superior efficiency Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) through student-led competitions.
- Establish an Open Access Repository with models, designs, fabrication know-how, and results.
- Support SME creation and spin-offs, encouraging entrepreneurship in the renewable sector.
- Advance blade pitch control technologies (passive, active, and cluster-level) to enhance VAWT performance.
# Repo
This repository is created to share code with students involved in the VAWT development competitions, as well as other researchers and organisations interested in wind energy.
